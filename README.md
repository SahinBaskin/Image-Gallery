Responsive Image Gallery

A simple and fully responsive Image Gallery built with HTML and CSS. This project displays a collection of 
images that automatically adjust to fit any screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices.

Key Features

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Randomized Images: On each page refresh, a new set of images is randomly displayed, 
offering a fresh visual experience every time.

Pure HTML & CSS: The gallery is implemented without any JavaScript libraries, 
relying solely on modern HTML and CSS techniques for a lightweight and fast performance.

How It Works:

The gallery uses media queries and flexible grid layouts to ensure responsiveness.

Each time the page is reloaded, a randomized set of images is selected and displayed,
making the gallery dynamic and engaging.
